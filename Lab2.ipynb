    "## PART II: Building and Training with TF-Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "In part II, you will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier. In our lecture, we have introduced CNN, a type of Deep Neural Network (DNN) that features convolutional layers. This [document][cnn_definition] by Stanford CS231n is also a good resource to learn more about CNN. You will build and train a simple CNN with TensorFlow on your own computers.\n",

    "\n",
    "There were two ways to construct and train a neural network model in TF1.x: Keras and low-level APIs. As Tensorflow evolves to 2.x, it leans more toward Keras, a higher-level framework than the previous version's low-level APIs. Keras APIs provide straightforward construction and training of neural networks, which hide away some tedious details of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some may argue that low-level APIs provide more precise control over some aspects of the network. While users can still find a way to tune the details by looking deeper into the APIs, the framework encourages them to focus on the big picture and develop better and more robust network models rather than fixating on trivialities. As a beginner, it is helpful for us to start with Keras and establish a basic intuition on how to build and train a simple network.\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the Fashion MNIST dataset. You can load the dataset in the following way, which is also shown in the tutorial:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist\n",
    "(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()\n",
    "```\n",
    "As discussed in the lecture, you should only use `train_images` and `train_labels` to train your model. You may also want to validate your model with a training/validation split. We will discuss the details in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build, Train, and Evaluate\n",
    "Generally, there are three stages in the process of developing a neural network: build, train, and evaluate. In Keras, there are corresponding functions for each stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build** First, you define the model architecture. In this lab, you can use a simple `keras.Sequential` function to define a model, as shown in this [example][sequential]. There are other ways to define a model, but we will not discuss those in this lab. After you have defined your model, you need to tell Keras what you want to do with it by compiling it. In the `model.compile` function, you specify the optimizer, loss function, metrics, and other configurations to prepare for training.\n",
    "2. **Train** You use `model.fit` function to train your model. In this function, you can specify the training parameters, including batch size, epochs, etc. You should specify your validation split in this function too. Please refer to the document and see how to do that.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate** After you have trained your model, you need to test the final accuracy using the testing data. The `model.evaluate` function gives you the percentage of the correct results. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the document for the above functions [here][fit_api].\n",
    "You may also find that in FashionNet, you use 2-D convolution in the first couple of layers. You may find [this document][layer_api] helpful since the `layers.Conv2D` and `layers.MaxPool2D` functions are not covered in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training of this CNN should not take a very long time on a laptop/desktop CPU. The final testing accuracy should be higher than 85%, and the training accuracy should be higher than 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot the Training Progress\n",
    "The `model.fit` function outputs a history of the training metrics (accuracy and loss), including validation metrics. This infomation can be very helpful for diagnosing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `matplotlib` to graph the model accuracy and loss on the training and validation dataset, and include them in your report.** The graph should look something like the following, but yours can be different if you have different configurations of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![train_img](figures/train.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Your Trained Model\n",
    "Finally, you will need to save your trained models to model files. Saving a trained model allows you to deploy it to other devices or restore previous training progress at a later time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this lab, we ask you to save it using **the TensorFlow SavedModel format**, which will contain the information of the model as well as the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Calling `save('my_model')` creates a SavedModel folder `my_model`.\n",
    "your_trained_model.save(\"my_model\")\n",

    "### Optimize your TFLite model with post-trainning quantization\n",
    "With the converter, we can directly transform our model to TFLite model; however, edge and IoT devices are usually low-powered and relatively lack computational power compared to PC. Therefore, to further enhance the performance, you can apply the post-training quantization technique before deploying the model onto the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, although the post-training quantization is similar to the quantization and retrain technique that we will introduce in Lecture 12, since the model will not be retrained after the quantization, the impact on the accuracy of the model is usually larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will need to apply two quantization methods, namely, **Dynamic range quantization** and **Full integer quantization**, listed in [this document][post-trainning quantization] to your pre-trained models and compare the accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) For dynamic range quantization, quantization parameters are automatically detected and generated by TensorFlow. Please write a piece of code to convert your original trained model into a TFLite model using dynamic range quantization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) For integer quantization, TensorFlow needs to sample the dataset you used for training the models to estimate the **MIN** and **MAX** values. This process can be described as \"representative data generation\". An example representative data generator is\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def representative_data_gen():\n",

However, you should notice that, while having a convenient python package, MTCNN is not dedicated to real-time detection on mobile devices. Therefore the inference latency is a few seconds on the Raspberry Pi.\n",

    "For this step, you will first instantiate the MTCNN from the mtcnn package. Then, write a function that does the following operations. The function prototype is given to you:\n",
    "1. Perform face detection with MTCNN and extract the bounding box of the first image.\n",
    "2. Add a 20% margin to each dimension of the bounding box, such that the bounding box is 120% of the original size in each dimension. That is, the bounding box is expanded by 10% in each direction(up, down, left, right).\n",
    "3. Perform image cropping according to the coordinate of the extended bounding box.\n",
    "4. Return the cropped image and the coordinates (x, y, w, h) of the bounding box.\n",

    "- For simplicity, you can assume that there is only one face in the input image.\n",
    "- The basic usage of MTCNN can be found in the MTCNN python package description [here][MTCNN_package]. As you may find out, the interface is very compact and intuitive. For this lab, you only need the 'box' from the output, which specifies the coordinates of a corner and the dimensions of the bounding box. You may need to install [MTCNN for TF Lite][MTCNN for TF Lite] on Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "- Performing the cropping on the OpenCV image is basically the same as working on a NumPy array, which you have already implemented in Lab 1. So you can borrow from your Lab 1 code if needed.\n",
